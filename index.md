## About Me

I am Kemou Li (<span style="font-family: '楷体', 'KaiTi'; font-size: inherit;">李科谋</span>), currently a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at [State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City (SKL-IoTSC)](https://skliotsc.um.edu.mo/), [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/), advised by Prof. [Jiantao Zhou](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/jtzhou/) (<span style="font-family: '楷体', 'KaiTi'; font-size: inherit;">周建涛</span>). Prior to that, I earned my B.Sc. degree in Mathematics from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/) and M.Sc. degree in Artificial Intelligence from University of Macau. I also work closely with Dr. [Fengpeng Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DgaQZ4wAAAAJ&hl=en), Dr. [Qizhou Wang](https://qizhouwang.github.io/homepage/), and Prof. [Haiwei Wu](https://www.scse.uestc.edu.cn/info/1081/16855.htm).

I am currently focusing on machine unlearning for LLMs and diffusion models, with an emphasis on theoretical foundations. I am also interested in broader topics in trustworthy machine learning. Previously, my research centered on adversarial robustness and learning with noisy labels. Please feel free to contact me through [WeChat](/assets/img/wechat_qr.png) or [email](mailto:kemou.li@connect.umac.mo) if you’d like to collaborate or exchange ideas on related topics :)
